## Fundamentals

### Overview & tips

Be sure to have a good grasp of the fundamentals that you have covered so far. These include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, APIs, React, etc. It's easy to try to memorize everything, and if that's what works for you go for it! I recommend, however, trying to focus on the why behind various things. **Why** are these technologies a thing? **What** problem are they solving? **How** can you leverage them?

Going deeper, a helpful technique for learning about topics that might seem daunting is the [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/). The goal of this technique is to attempt to teach a concept to someone else (real or imaginary). If you can teach someone, then you probably understand the topic! If you can't, then it helps you find the gaps in your knowledge so you can fill them in. The overarching process for the Feynman Technique is:

1. On a blank sheet of paper, write everything you know on a topic. You can do research on the topic at this point and add it to the sheet.
2. Attempt to teach the topic to someone. Suggestions include your siblings, your parents, your peers, your mentors, your pets, your Uber driver, etc. It can be helpful if whoever you are teaching isn't familiar with the topic (though not a requirement!).
3. "Reflect, refine, simplify." Make sure what you are saying would make sense to someone not familiar with the topic. Identify any areas where you found it difficult to teach and refine your understanding around that area.
4. Repeat 2 and 3 until you feel confident about your understanding of the topic ðŸ§ 

### Resources
Here are several resources on questions you might get on fundamentals. They likely go way more in-depth than you will be asked, so do not stress about memorizing them, but they are helpful for reference and review.

## Problem solving

### Overview & tips

Problem solving is another skill that is often tested for in interviews. As a software engineer, your job isn't to know everything - that would be impossible! However, it is important that you can use what you do know to solve a problem. We went over a lot of strategies on problem solving [here](https://github.com/bethanyj28/r2h-resources/tree/main/problem_solving) that I won't rehash - but I will leave some tips on how to do it in an interview-based setting.

1. It's okay to be nervous! Everybody is nervous during interviews, whether it's your first or your 1,000th. Your interviewer will also understand this and if they are a good interviewer they will be patient and helpful. If you feel overwhelmed it is completely okay to voice this to your interviewer.
2. The purpose of a problem solving interview isn't to watch you work out a problem effortlessly - it's to get an understanding about how you approach a problem. Do not feel defeated if you end up not solving the problem.
3. Overcommunicate. Even if you think you are wrong, voice what you are thinking. Your interviewer can't help you if they don't know what you're thinking.
4. Ask lots of questions! Even if you might think they're not worth asking. It's important to make sure you have all the information, because sometimes information is purposefully witheld to see how you ask questions.
5. Keep a log of all information given and all your thoughts. This can be comments on the code, a notebook you have on you, a google doc, etc. It's helpful to remove as much load on your brain as possible.

### Resources
[Google Coding Interview with a College Student (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q_oYDQ2whs) - This is likely more advanced than the questions you would get, but it's helpful to see how the interviewee looks at the problem and asks questions and understand how your interviewer might answer questions.

[Beginner React.js Coding Interview (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnkrDse9QKc) - I haven't watched through all of this, but it seems to line up more with the topics you'd be asked and has some funny moments.

### Practice problems
I ranked these in the order that I would think they'd be useful. Try to practice speaking your thoughts out loud, maybe even practice with your peers!

## Questions

One final tip I have is to come prepared with lots of questions for your interviewers. At the end of the interview, they will ask "Do you have any questions for me?" and you should **never ever** say "no". These are important for a few reasons:

1. An interview is not one way - they are not just interviewing you but you are also interviewing them to make sure this is somewhere you want to work. Do not give up your opportunity to ask questions because you have just as much right to ask them as they have to ask you questions!
2. When you ask questions, it shows you are engaged and eager about the company and the role.
3. Asking questions is a great way to leave a good, lasting impression on your interviewers. When I used to lead interviews, the most memorable were the ones where the interviewees had interesting questions.

Here are some tips for questions:
1. Think of your dream job, your dream company, where you want to be in 5 years, etc. Using these, ask questions to learn about whether this is a good company.
2. Write all these questions down somewhere you can access quickly during the interview. No one should fault you for having notes on these questions (if anything, they might admire you being prepared) and you should save your brain space by not trying to memorize these questions.
3. Try to tailor these questions to the interviewer. For example, you might be interviewed by someone who does not code. In those cases, it might not be the best to ask them about the tech stack you'd be working on.
4. Try to avoid asking the same questions to every interviewer. It's not necessarily a bad thing if you want different perspectives, but it might come across as you not putting effort into the questions if they bring it up when making a decision.
5. Try as best as you can to turn a question into a conversation and ask follow-up questions to show engagement and dig deeper. This can be difficult during an interview, but it's more memorable to have a conversation and make your interviewer feel like you're listening to them rather than doing rapid fire questions.
