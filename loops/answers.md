  <summary> How many times will these loops print "Party Time ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º" if time = 7? How about if time = 11?</summary>
  
  ## time = 7
  Both loops will print "Party Time ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º" four times.
  
  ## time = 11
  The while loop will not print anything but the do while loop will print "Party Time ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º" once.
