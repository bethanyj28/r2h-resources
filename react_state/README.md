# React State Practice

This is a simple exercise to practice using React state for both class and function components.

# Running the project
Clone this repo to your local dev environment. In this directory (`r2h-resources/react_state`), run the following:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This should install create-react-app if you don't have it and then starts the development server. It should open a window with the project running. It should look like this:
<img width="1439" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-18 at 8 16 32 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9900117/179638007-3b876508-f970-4123-94c8-c0b0a2796c1e.png">
If it doesn't open automatically, it typically will be running on `localhost:3000` (unless you have something else running).

# The prompt

Currently, when you click the `+` and `-` buttons, nothing happens. Your task is to update the components so that when the `+` button is clicked, it increments the big number. And when the `-` button is clicked, it decrements the big number.

# The solution

The code with the solution (or, at least how I would implement a solution) can be found [here](https://github.com/bethanyj28/r2h-resources/tree/react-solution/react_state). To view it on your local machine, pull the `react-solution` branch.
